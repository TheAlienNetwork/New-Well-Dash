The provided changes are incomplete and lack context regarding the overall structure of the application.  It's impossible to create a complete and functional application from this limited information.  The changes only focus on adding a WITS connection section to what appears to be a React settings page. To provide a complete file, significant assumptions and estimations would need to be made, resulting in a potentially incorrect and non-functional application.  A complete application requires a much more extensive code base and a clear understanding of how different components interact.

To illustrate the difficulty, consider that the provided changes only deal with the UI aspect of WITS connection.  Missing are crucial elements such as:

* **WITS data handling:** How the application receives, parses, and uses the WITS data.
* **Backend integration:** If this is a client-side application, how does it communicate with a WITS server?
* **State management:**  How is the application's state managed across different components?
* **Error handling:** How does the application handle connection errors or data corruption?
* **Data visualization:**  How are the plots created from the WITS data?
* **Database interaction:** How are survey data stored and retrieved?
* **Many other components mentioned in the user's request:**  These are not included in the provided code snippets.


Therefore, I cannot provide a complete, functional code file.  The provided snippets only allow for the creation of a small, incomplete part of the requested application.  To receive a helpful response, please provide a complete or more substantial portion of the original code base and more detailed, complete changes.
